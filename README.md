# CanGMap

A simple map showing the 100m no smoking areas around schools, pre schools, kindergartens and youth clubs for germanys CanG.

This is just a proof of concept. Hacked together without previous knowledge of Leaflet in just a few hours.

Also currently it does not show all areas needed. Play grounds and sport areas are not displayed yet for example.
